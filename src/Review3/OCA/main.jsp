<font color="red"><h2>Objective of the System:</h2></font>
<h3>
Our vision is to move beyond addressing the impact of child abuse 
by seeking out the root cause and identifying ways to prevent it.
We have to create awareness amongst masses on the issues related to 
child abuse. The proposed system tracks suspicious incidents of child
abuse by integrating reports based on numerous details and creating a
statistics based on these reports. This system verifies and reports 
incidents of abusive parents, physical and sexual abuse.
